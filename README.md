# JSimpleDungeon

JSimpleDungeon is Java-based framework dungeon crawler that I started working on for Out in Tech's 2024 Spring Mentorship program. It handles navigation, dialogue, battles, and saving. 
As a game developer experienced in engines and frontend work, I wanted to expand my skills to backend development. 
I intend to continue my work on JSimpleDungeon so that developers and designers can store game data in spreadsheets instead of JSON files. Additionally, I plan to enhance testing with in-depth JUnit practices. 



## Features

- Simple dialogue, battle, and navigation systems
- Encrypted save files
- Easy enemy editing with JSON
- JUnit Testing (Coming Soon!)
